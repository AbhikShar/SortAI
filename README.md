# üçΩÔ∏è Inspiration

In the world of food, our consumption habits seem to be increasing just as rapidly as the meals we savor. However, while our culinary techniques evolve, our food waste management practices often remain outdated. It's a concerning reality that a significant portion of our food, from everyday ingredients to complex recipes, ends up in the wrong disposal stream. These culinary missteps not only harm our environment but also result in lost opportunities to create delicious dishes from leftover ingredients.

For instance, a typical kitchen might have bins overflowing with ingredients that could have been repurposed into scrumptious meals, or worse, wasted food that contributes to environmental harm. Recognizing these culinary challenges, we were inspired to harness the power of AI to assist in proper food waste management. Enter SortAI, our culinary creation, and contribution towards reducing food waste and promoting sustainable cooking.

## üç≥ What SortAI Does

SortAI is an intuitive web application designed to help users identify and categorize their food items. Whether it's a wilted vegetable, a leftover slice of pizza, or an almost-expired carton of milk, SortAI can recognize it. Simply snap a picture of the item, and our AI will instantly tell you whether it can be used in a recipe, composted, or if it needs special handling.

But that's not all! We understand that users might have culinary questions or need more information. So, we've integrated an interactive chatbot to answer queries, provide cooking tips, and even share fun facts about food waste reduction.

## üß† How We Built SortAI

- **Backend Development:** We employed Django to create robust APIs.
- **Frontend Interaction:** AJAX ensures that the user experience remains seamless without unnecessary page reloads.
- **UI/UX:** Bootstrap aided us in creating a responsive and visually appealing interface.
- **AI Integration:** Hugging Face's API lets SortAI identify and categorize food items accurately.
- **Interactive Mapping:** We used the Folium Python library to guide users to the nearest composting facilities.
- **User Interaction:** Voiceflow powers our chatbot, making information access quick and interactive.

## üß© Challenges We Faced

Creating SortAI was no piece of cake. The integration of AI with real-time feedback was initially overwhelming, especially given the diverse range of food items. However, our collective passion and the joy of problem-solving kept us going.

## üèÜ Our Proud Moments

The birth of SortAI is a testament to our team's resilience and dedication. From integrating complex AI functionalities to fine-tuning the user interface, every hurdle we overcame was a moment of pride. But what truly warms our hearts is envisioning the positive culinary and environmental impact SortAI can make.

## üç¥ What We Learned

This journey taught us the immense potential of technology to address real-world culinary issues. We also learned the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and the continuous thirst for culinary knowledge.

## üöÄ Future of SortAI
